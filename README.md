## CodeWars

#### Parts of a list
- Write a function partlist that gives all the ways to divide a list (an array) of at least two elements into two non-empty parts.
    - Each two non empty parts will be in a pair (or an array for languages without tuples or a structin C - C: see Examples test Cases - )
    - Each part will be in a string
    - Elements of a pair must be in the same order as in the original array.
- Example:
```
a = ["az", "toto", "picaro", "zone", "kiwi"] --> 
answer: [["az", "toto picaro zone kiwi"], ["az toto", "picaro zone kiwi"], ["az toto picaro", "zone kiwi"], ["az toto picaro zone", "kiwi"]]
```

#### Couting Duplicates
- Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. The input string can be assumed to contain only alphanumeric characters, including digits, uppercase and lowercase alphabets.
- Example:
```
"abcde" -> 0 # no characters repeats more than once
"aabbcde" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
"aabbcdeB" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
"indivisibility" -> 1 # 'i'
"Indivisibilities" -> 2 # 'i' and 's'
"aa11" -> 2 # 'a' and '1'
```

#### Averages of numbers
- Write a method, that gets an array of integer-numbers and return an array of the averages of each integer-number and his follower, if there is one.
- Example:
```
Input:  [ 1, 3, 5, 1, -10]
Output:  [ 2, 4, 3, -4.5]
```
